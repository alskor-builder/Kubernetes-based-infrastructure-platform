- **Objective**: Learn to deploy your own Kubernetes cluster using Minikube for practice and testing purposes.
- **Tasks**:
  - Deploy a Kubernetes cluster with two virtual nodes using Minikube.
  - Use kubectl to check the version of the cluster and client.
  - Practice with various kubectl commands. (The most curious can practice with various kubectl commands using a cheat sheet. https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/quick-reference/)

- **Note**: You can specify the number of nodes using the --nodes parameter when starting a minikube cluster.
This assignment does not need to be tested, but it is required for homework.
